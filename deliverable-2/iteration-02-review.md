 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 3 (Thursday), During Tutorial
 * Where: Zoom

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

* Discord
  * Having discord channel has been one of the best decisions we've made. Through the channel, every member was able to actively send and discuss about works. It also has been used to send a reminder about the meeting, and its voice channel has been used for our regular team meeting method. Furthermore, it was great to see active participation rate to the regular team meeting from every member. Lastly, different channels inside the group chat helped us keep the flow of conversation on one topic. 

* API documentation
  * We've decided to create an API documentation, and this led to make the Frontend team easily call requests to retrieve information on their side. Furthermore, providing the example of retrieved data helped the Frontend team know about how to use it to display what they want. So, this has been one of the successful communication method between Frontend and Backend team. 

* Creating the design early
  * By designing the webpages earlier, the Frontend team didn't need to spend much time on figuring how to do structuralizing and styling the website. And this led them focus more on working for components and API calls. 


#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

We have done our product demo on our regular meeting time on November 3 on Zoom. With the agreement from the partner, we've recorded our demo and included the link of recording above. 

In this demo, we've managed to show the following features:
- Main page of displaying the list of all books and "browse by topic" section
- Book details page
  - Basic information about books
  - list of exercises on these books (each item shows the title of book & exercise, page numbers, and author)
  - navigating to the page where the user can buy a book
- Exercise details page
  - information about books (page, tenor, etc.)
- Search page

During the demo, our partner commented that it is good to see the required features she was asking during the deliverable 1. But there were a list of requests of improving the product for the next deliverable:
- On the book details page, we can just display the page number and the list of relevant tags that each exercise has. And we can remove the author & title. 
- On the exercise detail page, we can display more information about the exercise, such as level, tags, and other information that are written on the spreadsheet that the partner gave us.
- On the search page, we again need to think about the important information that users actually want to see. (like what this exercise is about)
- We can later add "link to creator's information" section to show the credits of partners and our team members for development. 


Overall, it was meaningful to get an active feedback in the middle of development process in which we can quickly find the solution and make changes. Furthermore, this demo especially lets us have a time to think about what are the important information that users want to see.
