# Cello Exercise Index / TBD

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 3 (Thursday), During Tutorial
 * Where: Zoom

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

* Discord
  * Having discord channel has been one of the best decisions we've made. Through the channel, every member was able to actively send and discuss about works. It also has been used to send a reminder about the meeting, and its voice channel has been used for our regular team meeting method. Furthermore, it was great to see active participation rate to the regular team meeting from every member. Lastly, different channels inside the group chat helped us keep the flow of conversation on one topic. 

* API documentation
  * We've decided to create an API documentation, and this led to make the Frontend team easily call requests to retrieve information on their side. Furthermore, providing the example of retrieved data helped the Frontend team know about how to use it to display what they want. So, this has been one of the successful communication method between Frontend and Backend team. 

* Creating the design early
  * By formulating the desings earlier (in deliverable 1) for the website in Figma, the Frontend team didn't need to spend much time on figuring out how the website look like in terms of where components will be placed and what would be the main styles (font, color, etc.). As we created a pretty detailed Figma mockup of all of the different pages in out website, we all had a clear vision of what the final product should look like and it was a useful reference for the frontend team. And this allowed the frontend team to focus more on actual coding in deliverable 2 like building the necessary components, integrating api calls and the website layout in general. Plus, as we already got an approval from the client on the design, we were confident about what we were building.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Work Distribution
  * In Deliverable 2, getting the database set up with relevant api calls was of most importance so more people were assigned to the backend team (4 people). As we now have the database implemented, with many of the necessary api calls, we will now need more people to work on the frontend for deliverable 3. There is still a lot of work for the frontend, as we have to implement filtering, searching and lazy loading features. To distribute this work fairly, we think that adding another person to the frontend team will help the team as it will ease the load for each member. 

 * Task Management
  * For the next deliverables, we would like to utilize the Trello board more. So far, we have been documenting the tasks in our trello board but we haven't been marking the tasks as done when we have finished it. We have been communicating on Discord to keep track of what has or has not been completed, but as messages can be drowned out by other messages, we think that it would be better to have a main, reliable one-stop shop for task management which would be our Trello board. Therefore, we will prioritize making sure that we mark tasks as done in Trello as soon as we have completed it so that other members can know what the progress of tasks are easily and conveniently.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

We have done our product demo on our regular meeting time on November 3 on Zoom. With the agreement from the partner, we've recorded our demo and included the link of recording above. 

In this demo, we've managed to show the following features:
- Main page of displaying the list of all books and "browse by topic" section
- Book details page
  - Basic information about books
  - list of exercises on these books (each item shows the title of book & exercise, page numbers, and author)
  - navigating to the page where the user can buy a book
- Exercise details page
  - information about books (page, tenor, etc.)
- Search page

During the demo, our partner commented that it is good to see the required features she was asking during the deliverable 1. But there were a list of requests of improving the product for the next deliverable:
- On the book details page, we can just display the page number and the list of relevant tags that each exercise has. And we can remove the author & title. 
- On the exercise detail page, we can display more information about the exercise, such as level, tags, and other information that are written on the spreadsheet that the partner gave us.
- On the search page, we again need to think about the important information that users actually want to see. (like what this exercise is about)
- We can later add "link to creator's information" section to show the credits of partners and our team members for development. 


Overall, it was meaningful to get an active feedback in the middle of development process in which we can quickly find the solution and make changes. Furthermore, this demo especially lets us have a time to think about what are the important information that users want to see.
