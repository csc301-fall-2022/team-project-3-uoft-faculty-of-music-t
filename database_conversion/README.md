# What is this?
Converts the old .csv files provided by partner into new .csv files representing our database classes. Each file is what we'll make a new table for, and the columns are the data columns. Each exercise is also now linked to it's respective book. This will make it easier to convert the .csv to whatever database we use. 

A picture of what our database schema looks like is in schema.png (subject to change).

The python file has already been run and the generated files are now in new_csv.

To run locally, just run the create_modified_csv.py file.

# TODO: 
- Convert the newly generated .csv files to .sql files and create the database.
