Most importantly, it is a reflection of all the planning you work you've done in the first iteration. 
 > **This document will serve as a master plan between your team, your partner and your TA.**

## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

 > Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
    * Assume your the reader knows nothing about the problem domain and provide the necessary context. 
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.

One main problem that cellists have encountered for a long time is wasting time and money on finding great resources for practicing cello. For instance, students need to find good cello teachers for having 1-on-1 lessons while teachers have difficulty in finding the teaching materials. 

To solve this inconvenient situation, we are planning to create an website called, **“Cello Exercise Index”**, in which anyone who plays cello can easily find exercises that are suitable for their levels and interests.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

  > Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * **Feel free to use personas. You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).**

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

> Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

:memo: **Draft** :memo:

Currently, there are many books containing valuable technical exercises for the Cello, but discovering and navigating through them is difficult and cumbersome. Performers, students and teachers of an instrument know what technical skills they or their student has a lack of ability in, and technical books are an asset that can help improve their skills. As the website will contain a collection of Cello technical books and their corresponding exercises, which will have tags such as “trills” or “scales”, etc. and page numbers associated with each exercise, cellists will be able to filter and search for specific types of exercises quickly.

For Cello students, having the ability to discover exercise books conveniently from online means that they do not have to access a Cello teacher in order to know what exercise books to get, saving them money. For Cello teachers, if a student is struggling with a technical skill on the Cello and they are looking for exercise books to complement their teaching, teachers will be able to quickly find an exercise book for that skill.

https://imslp.org/ is a large digital music library containing public domain music scores, works and recordings. It allows users to view a list of only Cello exercise books but navigating to this page is not very clear and confusing. It also does not allow users to filter the list of books into specific types of exercises. The way our website will differ and bring value that imslp does not, is to have a simple and easily navigable UI, and a detailed filtering system to fit each Cellists’ needs.

------------------------------------------------------

#### Q4: How will you build it?

> Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify any and all languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools. 
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here. 
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?
 * What is your testing strategy?

:memo: **Draft** :memo:

------------------------------------------------------

#### Q5: What are the user stories that make up the MVP?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * User stories must contain acceptance criteria. Examples of user stories with different formats can be found here: https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-story-examples/. **It is important that you provide a link to an artifact containing your user stories**.
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them. You need to include the evidence of partner approval (e.g., screenshot from email) or at least communication to the partner (e.g., email you sent)

## Process Details

#### Q6: What are the roles & responsibilities on the team?

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role. 
 * Roles should reflect the structure of your team and be appropriate for your project. Not necessarily one role to one team member.  
 * Add role(s) to your Team-[Team_Number]-[Team_Name].csv file on the main folder

### Role List
- Frontend Developer (React components)
- Frontend Developer (User interface/experience)
- Backend Developer (Database manager/designer)
- Backend Developer (Server-side programming)
- Coordinator (To handle biweekly meetings with partner)

List each team member and:
 * A description of their role(s) and responsibilities including the components they'll work on and non-software related work
 * 3 technical strengths and weaknesses each (e.g. languages, frameworks, libraries, development methodologies, etc.)

#### Q7: What operational events will you have as a team?

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have. 
 * When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync meeting online, etc.
 * You should have at least 2 meetings with your project partner (if you have one) before D1 is due. Describe them here:
   * What did you discuss during the meetings?
   * What were the outcomes of each meeting?
   * You must keep track of meeting minutes and add them to your repo.
   * You must have a regular meeting schedule established by the second meeting.  
 
We will have weekly team meetings on zoom on Saturdays. The regular meeting will start at 1:00 p.m. We try to plan meetings when most members are able to attend, and leave notes for those who cannot make it. In each meeting, we want to update everyone with the information from the project partner and address any questions. Then, each team can report their progress and discuss any concerns or difficulties they encounter. We can set expectations and make accommodations if needed.
 
We have had 2 meetings with the project partner. We have discussed the outline of this project and presented the user stories and design mockups. We also discussed details on how the provided data should be managed and organized. After the first meeting, we learned what our partner wants and how the data works. After the second meeting, we have the user stories and design mockups approved with some feedbacks for further improvement. 
 
Meeting minutes:
 
* Week of Sep 19: about 45 minutes
* Week of Sep 26: about 30 minutes
 
Our regular meeting schedule is on Thursday mornings at 11:00 a.m.
  
#### Q8: What artifacts will you use to self-organize?

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), meeting minutes, etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * **How do you prioritize tasks?**
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?
   * How do you determine the status of work from inception to completion?
 
For every meeting we have with ourselves, or with the partner, in order to document our discussions, we will create a meeting document, where a designated note taker will take notes during the meeting. We will try to have a checklist of what items we should talk about in the meeting document before going into the meeting so that our time can be used productively. 
 
In terms of organizing tasks, we will use Trello. In the Trello board, we will create task items and distribute them into 3 columns (lists): “To-do”, “In-Progress” and “Completed” to track the progress of the tasks (from inception to conception). We will most likely organize the project into sprints, in which tasks will be prioritized by what needs to be finished in the current sprint or by deadlines in the course. In general, items that depend on the backend team to complete for the frontend team to progress and vice versa should be prioritized so that we minimize the time that people may be blocked in impacting the website. 

In terms of assigning tasks, for every sprint, we will designate a meeting time for sprint planning where we talk about the items we should complete for the current sprint, and assign tasks equally to every team member.

#### Q9: What are the rules regarding how your team works?

Describe your team's working culture.

**Communications:**

 * What is the expected frequency? What methods/channels are appropriate? 
 * If you have a partner project, what is your process (in detail) for communicating with your partner?

:memo: **Answer** :memo:

Discord is used for text discussion and weekly voice chat meetings. Meetings between all members are expected to be weekly. Text discussion is held between meeting times whenever it is needed to discuss a topic. A Discord webhook is set to Discord to notify members when an action is done on Github, so team members can check and discuss commits/pull requests in Discord as well.

Communication with our partner is done through email. A meeting is held on Zoom between Alan, Rachel, Mark and our partner every other Thursday.

**Meetings:**
 * How are people held accountable for attending meetings, completing action items? Is there a moderator or process?

:memo: **Answer** :memo:
 
Currently, we are running on an honor system - if someone says they are going to do something, they are expected to do it. However, if someone ends up missing meetings and not completing action items for no valid reason, someone from our group will send them a message inquiring about it. If it keeps happening for no valid reason, conversation will happen with the TA.

## Highlights

Specify 3 - 5 key decisions and/or insights that came up during your meetings
and/or collaborative process.

 * Short (5 min' read max)
 * Decisions can be related to the product and/or the team process.
    * Mention which alternatives you were considering.
    * Present the arguments for each alternative.
    * Explain why the option you decided on makes the most sense for your team/product/users.
 * Essentially, we want to understand how (and why) you ended up with your current product and process plan.
 * This section is useful for important information regarding your decision making process that may not necessarily fit in other sections. 

:memo: **Answer** :memo:
 
1) While figuring out our tech stack, we were deciding between Node (with Express) and Django for our backend, since those were the two that those on our team had some experience on. For Node, we thought that it would be easier to work with since our front end is React. For Django, we thought it would be a good choice since multiple of our members are taking CSC309 and would thus acquire more in depth experience with Django than React through university projects. We ended up going with Django as it made more sense to go with the option that more people in our team will eventually be comfortable using.
2) We had multiple discussions on whether or not we should embed a PDF for each exercise into their respective exercise page. The for argument, was that it would help students be able to easily access their exercise from the page without any hassle. The against argument was that it would be too difficult to get all the exercise pages (since we would have to do it manually, and all of them may not even exist on the internet) and we may also run into copyright issues. We decided in the end to not embed a pdf, however to have a link to the book on IMSLP (to freely download it) or where they can purchase the book. This will help users be able to quickly find the book they need, without our team running into copyright issues and manually looking for the pages online.
3) Another decision we made was where we should hold our conversations. Several options that came up but the larger ones were Microsoft Teams and Discord. For Teams, that would be good since it is directly connected to our university accounts and we would also be able to schedule meetings with delivered notifications to our university email. For Discord, we would be able to create a Github to Discord webhook to easily notify members about actions on Github, and we could split the channels for better organization. As well, a lot of our team members frequently use Discord so it would be more checked than Microsoft Teams would. Discord ended up being the better option, as we would be able to easily pin tasks that needed to be done which would ease the task delegation process to each member, and have a Github to Discord webhook to notify team members of Github activity.
